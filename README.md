# PersonalityQuiz
Simple iOS App, done as guided project for learning purposes in 2020 May.

## Description:
Player is presented with a topic “Which animal are you?” and answer questions that align them to a particular outcome. 
The four possible outcomes are: dog🐶, cat🐱, rabbit🐰, and turtle🐢.
Just take it easy !!! There are no correct answers to quiz questions! :smile::smile::smile:

#### This app accomplish three main goals:
  1. Introduce the player to the quiz.
  
  2. Present questions and answers.
  
  3. Display the results.
  
## Implementation: 
There are three view controllers used for that app:

1. The first is an introduction screen with information about the quiz and a button to begin.

2. The second view controller displays a question and several answers, and manages the responses. This view controller is refreshed for each question, and depending on what kind of question, the right controls will be displayed:

Here above:
   __Question #1__ is a multiple-choice question, where only one answer is valid.
    For this question, here is used a button for each food.
   
   __Question #2__ can have zero or more answers. Here are used switches, so players can select as many foods as they like, as well as a button to submit their choices.
   
   __Question #3__ involves a 0-to-1 scale slider for choosing answer and button to submit that answer.
      

3. The third view controller tallies up the answers and presents the final outcome. This result can be dismissed, allowing another player to start the quiz from the first view controller.
